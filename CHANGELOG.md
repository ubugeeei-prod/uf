# Changelog

## uf@0.0.0-alpha.3

_2026-09-05_

### Added

- **explain**: say who does the work for every command that delegates (#167)
- **web**: the primitives a page is built from, and three rules that were wrong (#119)
- **test**: a clock a test controls, and the namespace `uft` (#115)
- **cli**: add Flow API docs command (#121)
- **test**: snapshots, and the discipline that makes them a test (#118)
- **test**: the matchers that stand in for a value instead of being one (#114)
- **relay**: Relay, re-exported by name — and the environment nobody should rewrite (#110)
- **server**: the request a server function is inside (#109)
- **stylex**: the compiler was written and nothing ever called it (#108)
- **check**: the platform globals, and a mark drawn at its own proportions (#107)
- **cli**: completion that knows this project, and errors that name the fix (#101)

### Fixed

- **fmt**: an object's spread keeps its parentheses (#160)
- **project**: a file that cannot be read does not stop the project (#165)
- **fmt**: a comment type declaration stays a comment (#154)
- **fmt**: a comment after a class's type parameters ends its line too (#156)
- **fmt**: a comment type stays a comment (#148)
- **fmt**: refuse a chain that nests without brackets (#149)
- **fmt**: a comment before `extends` stays where it was written (#144)
- **fmt**: a right-nested logical chain lays out like a left-nested one (#139)
- **packages**: declare the validator @uniflowed/ui imports (#150)
- **fmt**: an inferred predicate keeps the colon it stands after (#140)
- **fmt**: JSX that runs out at end of input is refused (#132)
- **vite**: decide a Flow keyword by the line, not by the token (#123)
- **pm**: a submodule is not one of this project's packages (#124)
- **fmt**: a contextual keyword at the start of a statement keeps its parens (#122)
- **core**: the root entry point re-exported two files that were never written (#95)

### Performance

- **fmt**: print each call argument once (#145)

### Documentation

- say that formatter fixtures are data (#158)
- everything after one bootstrap line is a `uf` command (#116)
- what closing each red line would take, and the failure none of them prevent (#102)

### Internal

- reformat the packages the spread-parentheses fix changed (#182)
- **release**: read back what actually reached npm (#147)
- **upstream**: pin React, Relay and React Native beside Flow (#141)
- **fmt**: eleven more Flow codebases in the corpus (#138)
- **fmt**: keep the reproductions for three filed bugs in the repository (#129)
- **fmt**: the formatter's guarantees, over Flow nobody here wrote (#127)
- **release**: see a half-sent release before tagging, not during (#117)
- **publish**: drop a preflight that could never pass (#94)

### Other

- rename (#131)
- Add ubugeeei Redundancy Guide for uf project
- Four fixes: a replaceable formatter, three wrong lint rules, star re-exports, and a bundler `uf test` never loaded (#112)
